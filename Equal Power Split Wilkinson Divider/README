Project 1: Equal Power Split Wilkinson Divider (5.65–5.925 GHz)

**Objective:**  
Design a Wilkinson power divider with equal power split for use in a phased array system, implemented in microstrip on Rogers RO4003C™ substrate (32 mil, 1 oz copper).

**Specifications:**
- Frequency Range: 5650–5925 MHz  
- Input Impedance: 50 Ω  
- Output Impedance: 100 Ω  
- S11 < -20 dB (input reflection)  
- S22, S33 < -20 dB (output reflection)  
- Isolation S32 < -35 dB  
- Power split variation: ±0.2 dB  

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Microstrip transmission line design
- ADS built-in models for discontinuities and T-junctions
- 0402-sized real components (Murata, Panasonic)
- Physically realizable layout with 0.25" input/output matching lines
- Momentum EM co-simulation
